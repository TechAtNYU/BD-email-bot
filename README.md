# BD-email-bot

** Aneesh Ashutosh **

I developed this script to automate the sending of emails for Tech@NYU's business development team. Previously, we would have to manually send emails to everyone we wished to reach out to. This is not sufficient in our modern time when human labor is so valuable and we have the opportunity to replace it completely with robots.

# Example Usage

`python mailbot.py`

# To-do
- Read input files to send emails
- Take username and password via command line
- Use variable replacement to easily send many messages
- Figure out how to log in through NYU email
