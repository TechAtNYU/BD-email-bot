# BD-email-bot

**Aneesh Ashutosh**

I developed this script to automate the sending of emails for Tech@NYU's business development team. Previously, we would have to manually send emails to everyone we wished to reach out to. This is not sufficient in our modern time when human labor is so valuable and we have the opportunity to replace it completely with robots.

# Installation

`git clone https://github.com/TechAtNYU/BD-email-bot.git`

`cd BD-email-bot`


# Example Usage

**To create a json object and save it into example.json**

`python generate-json.py example.json`

**To execute the bot from the contents of example.json**

`python mailbot.py example.json`

# To-do
- Figure out how to log in through NYU email
